# Oil-in-Place-Calculator
Just trying out some codes to find the oil in place

This code was written in `C/C++`.

The program works fine if the correct data is supplied. However, the following are still pending.

- Error handling is incomplete, mainly when letters are used.
- trying to work on stabilizing/ specifying the range of the `So` and `porosity` values. It should be within `0-1` 

Any help will be much appreciated
