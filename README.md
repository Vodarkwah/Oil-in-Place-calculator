# Oil-in-Place-calculator
Just trying out some codes to find the oil in place

This code was written in c/c++.

Program works fine if correct data is supplied. However, the following are still pending.

- error handling incomplete, especially when letters are used.
- trying to work on stabilizing/ specifying the range of the So and por values. It should be within 0-1 

Any help will be much appreciated
